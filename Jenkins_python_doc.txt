To run Python on Jenkins

issue: when i run the python script from my local, i was getting error as Python not recognized. Tried many options but no luck!!

Followed below steps to correct it:
If your command runs fine on Win command prompt as user 'X', then you should run Jenkins with the same user.

This can be achieved by performing following steps:
1. Run > services.msc (Enter)
2. Select Jenkins service. Right-click and select Properties
3. Click on Log On tab
4. Select user 'X' and provide credentials
5. Restart Jenkins.
